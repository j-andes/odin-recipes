                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Looking for the perfect meal for date night or family dinner? Then you have come to the right place! Steak 
                        dinners are commonplace in many American households. However, I'm sure that we have all encountered our fair 
                        share of steaks that we wish that we could forget. I was personally convinced as a child and throughout my 
                        teenage years that I didn't like steak whatsoever. That is becuase cooking a good steak can be very difficult 
                        to those who do not have experience cooking steaks. In this recipe, we will cover how to cook a great steak, at 
                        the perfect temperature, and how to add <em>even more</em> flavor to your steak dinner by adding herbs and seasoning.</p>
                    
                    <p>This recipe will require you to use a cast iron skillet. If you do not own a cast iron skillet, you are able to use 
                        a normal skillet/frying pan, however the finished product is <strong>MUCH</strong> tastier when using a cast 
                        iron skillet. You will also want your skillet to be properly seasoned before attempting to cook a steak. If you 
                        have not properly seasoned your skillet or don't even know where to start with seasoning your skillet, you can follow
                        <a href="https://www.lodgecastiron.com/discover/cleaning-and-care/cast-iron/all-about-seasoning">this</a> article by 
                        Lodge Cast Iron to do so BEFORE you start cooking. You will also need a pot large enough to boil potato chunks, as 
                        well as a baking sheet and aluminum foil to cook your asparagus. Lastly, this recipe is designed to serve 2 people. If 
                        you are cooking for 3 or more, I recommend doubling or tripling the allotted measurements in the "ingredients" section.

                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ribeye Steak (should be about 1-1.5 inches thick)</li>
                                <li>1 stick unsalted grass-fed butter (8 tbsp)</li>
                                <li>2-3 large russett potatoes</li>
                                <li>1 bundle asparagus</li>
                                <li>1 garlic clove</li>
                                <li>5 tbsp coarse-ground kosher salt</li>
                                <li>3 tbsp coarse-ground black pepper</li>
                                <li>1 package fresh rosemary (on the stem)</li>
                                <li>3 tbsp olive oil (extra virgin or regular)</li>
                                <li>2 tbsp fine-ground salt</li>
                                <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
                            </ul>
                                <h4>Steps</h4>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Fill a large pot 1/2 full with water. Set your pot of water on the stove on a meduim-high heat to bring to a boil.</li>
                                        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees farenheit.</li>
                                        <li>Start by peeling the skin off of your russet potatoes and cutting the potatoes into 1-2 inch chunks or cubes.</li>
                                        <li>Add your potatoes to the water <em>before</em> the water starts boiling. This allows the potatoes to cook through evenly.</li>
                                        <li>While your potatoes are starting to cook, take out your steaks and set them on your cutting board to begin to slowly warm up to room temperature. 
                                            We do this so that the steak can cook more evenly throughout, rather than having a steak that is perfectly seared on the outside, while still 
                                            being raw in the middle.</li>
                                        <li>Once your steaks are out of the fridge, take your asparagus spears and cut the bottom 1-3 inches of the spears off. Then wash your asparagus with cold water.</li>
                                        <li>Line your baking sheet with foil. Then proceed to lay your asparagus on the baking sheet evenly, so that the spears cook evenly throughout.</li>
                                        <li>Add 3 tbsp of olive oil, 1 tbsp coarse-ground kosher salt, and 1 tbsp coarse-ground black pepper to the asparagus, again coating the spears evenly.</li>
                                        <li>Put you asparagus in the oven to bake at 400 degrees farenheit for 25 minutes.</li>
                                        <li>Check your potatoes. The potatoes should be fork-tender (the prongs of a fork easily penetrate the potato) when they are finished cooking. It is best to check 
                                            on your poatatoes early and often. Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain them with a collander</li>
                                        <li>Put cast-iron skillet on a medium-high heat.</li>
                                        <li>Now go back to your steaks. Season each steak with 2 tbsp coarse-ground koshe salt, 1 tbsp coarse-ground black pepper, and 1 tbsp garlic powder. Make sure to 
                                            cover the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> steak (including the edges) with your seasonings.</li>
                                        <li>Once your skillet is hot, add your 2 steaks to the pan. Make sure that your steaks are not touching. You should hear a loud sizzling/searing sound come from the pan. 
                                            If you do not hear this sound, your pan is not hot enough and you need to wait to add your steaks.</li>
                                        <li>Cook your steaks on this side for 3-4 minutes. To create a great "crust" for the steaks, make sure not to move them for this first 3-4 minutes. The crust 
                                            locks the flavors of the steaks and seasoning in.</li>
                                        <li>Once the 3-4 minutes is up, flip your steaks using kitchen tongs.</li>
                                        <li>Now, add 2-3 tbsp of unsalted grass-fed butter to the pan and add your peeled garlic clove. Also add 1 sprig of rosemary over the top of each steak.</li>
                                        <li>Baste your steaks in the melted garlic butter. Do this by tilting your skillet to one side so that all of the butter pools in one part of your skillet. 
                                            Then with a spoon, proceed to pour the butter over the steaks and rosemary sprigs until they are fully covered with the butter. This step usually takes about 
                                            30-45 seconds.</li>
                                        <li>Continue cooking steaks for another 2-4 minutes without moving them.</li>
                                        <li>Once the second side of your steaks are done, grab your first steak with your tongs and sear each edge of the steak for 15-30 seconds per side. You will want to 
                                            do this around the entire edge of each steak. This renders (breaks down) the fat, making the fat more flavorful and palatable. Do this step for each steak.</li>
                                        <li>Set steaks aside to rest on your cutting board or on a plate. Do not, I repeat <strong><em>DO NOT</em></strong> cut into your steaks before allowing them to rest for at least 7-10 minutes. 
                                        Resting your steaks will allow the cooking process to continue within the steaks</li>
                                        <li>Now add your cooked potatoes back to the pot.</li>
                                        <li>To the potatoes, add the rest of your unsalted grass-fed butter.</li>
                                        <li>Mash the potatoes and butter together with a potato masher. You will notice the butter melting and the potatoes becoming less "chunky"</li>
                                        <li>Add your 2 tbsp of fine-ground salt and 3/4 cup of milk and mix. I usually continue to use the potato masher to mix in this step until the larger chunks of potato are gone. THen, I will use a 
                                            slotted serving spoon to finish mixing.</li>
                                        <li>Lastly, slice your steaks into 1/2 inch slices cutting <em>against</em> the natural grain of the meat</li> 
                                        <li>Plate and serve your meal. There will most likely be left over potatoes and asparagus which will reheat beautifully within the next 48 hours.</li>
