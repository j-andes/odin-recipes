                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Start a large pot of water boiling.</li>
                                <li>Add salt to the water (about 1tbsp for every 2 quarts of water) </li>
                                <li>In a large skillet, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil on medium-high heat</li>
                                <li>Once the pan is hot, add your ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
                                <li>Remove ground beef from the skillet into a separate bowl</li>
                                <li>Drain fat rom skillet. Leave about 1 tbsp of fat in the pan</li>
                                <li>With the skillet still on medium-high heat, add in your diced pepper and onion as well as your minced garlic. Cook for 3-5 minutes until pepper and onion are softened, stirring regularly.</li>
                                <li>Once the peppers and onions are softened, return your ground beef to the pan, stir to combine the meat and veggies.</li>
                                <li>Reduce skillet heat to low and cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
                                <li>Transfer meat and veggies to a medium sized pot.</li>
                                <li>With the pot on medium-high heat, add tomatoe sauce, canned tomatoes, tomato paste, and all other herbs and spices listed in the "Ingredients" section above (Basically, add everything to the pot that is not noodles, cheese, or the water that you are boiling currently).</li>
                                <li>Make sure to scrape the bottom of the pot often to prevent your sauce from burning.</li>
                                <li>Once the sauce is boiling, reduce heat to low and let simmer.</li>
                                <li>Add lasagna noodles to your boiling water</li>
                                <li>Cook the noodles al dente per the directions on the package, stirring often to prevent the noodles from sticking to eachother</li>
                                <li>When the noodles are finished cooking, drain them in a collander.</li>
                                <li>Immediately rinse noodles with cool water and gently separate any noodles that may be sticking together.</li>
                                <li>On a large limmed baking sheet, add and spread 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
                                <li>Lay cooked noodles on the pan and flip each noodle over once to ensure that both sides of the noodle have olive oil on them. This will prevent sticking as we assemble our lasagna.</li>
                                <li>Heat oven to 375 degrees farenheit</li>
                                <li>In a 9x13-inch casserole dish or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread so that it covers the entire bottom of the baking dish.</li>
                                <li>Add lasagna noodles length-wise to cover the sauce.</li>
                                <li>Ladle 1/3 of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</li>
                                <li>Sprinkle 1/2 cup (8 oz) mozzarella cheese over the sauce in an even layer</li>
                                <li>Add 1/2 (7.5 oz) of the ricotta cheese by placing cheese dollops about 2 inches apart from eachother.</li>
                                <li>Sprinkle 1/2 (2 oz) of the parmesan cheese evenly over the mozzarella and ricotta.</li>
                                <li>Add a second layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
                                <li>Add 1/2 of the remaining sauce over the noodles. Spread evenly.</li>
                                <li>Add 1/2 (8 oz) of the remaining mozzarella. Spread evenly.</li>
                                <li>Add the rest of the ricotta cheese, using the same method as you did with the first layer.</li>
                                <li>Add the remaining parmesan cheese. Spread evenly.</li>
                                <li>Add your final layer of noodles.</li>
                                <li>Spread the remaining sauce atop the noodles evenly.</li>
                                <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese evenly over the top.</li>
                                <li>Cover the pasta in foil and bake at 375 degrees farenheit for 45 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Remove from oven. Let rest 15 minutes before serving.</li>
