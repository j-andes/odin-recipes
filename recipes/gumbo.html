                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>In my opinion, there is nothing better on a cold winter's day than a hot bowl of chicken and sausage gumbo,
                        Gumbo is a cajun dish that begins with a dark roux. Making the roux can be the trickiest part of making your 
                        gumbo. Making roux is a very delicate and time consuming process. I have forewarned you. If you do not wish 
                        to spend 45 minutes to 2 hours making a roux, you have a couple of options. 1: You can choose to not make gumbo. 
                        Good gumbo requires roux, and there is no substitute. Anyone who tells you different is either lying, or has never 
                        tasted <strong>real</strong> gumbo before. 2: You can buy pre-made roux in a jar. This will work just as well as 
                        making your own roux at home, however you cannot control how dark you want your roux to be. Buying pre-jarred roux 
                        will do nothing to compromise the flavor and is a great way to get started cooking gumbo without having to make your 
                        own roux.</p>
                    <p>Making gumbo in itself is a slow process. It is one of those meals where the longer you cook it, the better it tastes. 
                        I have made gumbo in under 2 hours, and I have made gumbo that simmered for 24 hours. Can you guess which one tasted 
                        better? Of course it was the one that simmered for 24 hours! The longer you simmer your gumbo, the more time the 
                        different flavors in the pot have to come together. It also will boil out a lot of the water, making your gumbo 
                        thicker, heartier, and <strong><em>MUCH</em></strong> tastier. So if you are in a pinch for time, you can cook your gumbo 
                        fairly quickly. However, I would strongly advise that you allow the gumbo to simmer for at least 5 hours before serving.</p>

                                <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
                                <li>3 cups long grain white rice</li>
                                <li>2 lbs chicken thighs</li>
                                <li>2 links Johnsonville beef smoked sausage</li>
                                <li>1 package Kroger frozen cajun mirepoix mix</li>
                                <li>1 tbsp Tony Chachere's seasoning (green canister)</li>
                                <li>3 tbsp Louisiana Hot Sauce</li>
                                <li>2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
                                <li>3 bay leaves</li>
                            
                            </ul>
                                <h4>Steps</h4>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>To make your roux, begin by adding your flour and vegetable oil to a skillet on medium-high heat.</li>
                                        <li>Mix oil an flour together using a whisk until fully combined and no clumps of flour.</li>
                                        <li>Continuously stir the oil and flour, not allowing the ingredients to sit still in the skillet 
                                            for more than 30 seconds at a time. If left unattended, your roux will burn and you will need 
                                            to start over</li>
                                        <li>Continue stirring until the oil and flour mixture turn to a milk chocolate color.</li>
                                        <li>If at any point the mixture starts to clump up, add a little bit of oil to thin the mixture out. 
                                            This clumping usually happens about 10-15 minutes into cooking your roux. Make sure not to add too much oil!</li>
                                        <li>Once the mixture is a milk chocolate color, your roux is complete! We will only be needing some of the roux that 
                                            we made today. The rest can be jarred and kept in the fridge for your next gumbo!</li>
                                        <li>Fill an 8 quart pot about 1/2 full of water. Bring to a boil on high heat.</li>
                                        <li>Add 1/2 cup of roux. Stir until fully dissolved in the water. (If you don't stir, the roux can sit at the bottom of the 
                                            pot and burn)</li>
                                        <li>Once the roux is fully dissolved, add your bag of cajun mirepoix mix</li> 
                                        <li>Once the water is back to a rolling boil, add your Tony Chachere's seasoning, Louisiana Hot Sauce, black pepper, and bay leaves.</li>
                                        <li>Let cook for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                                        <li>While the veggies and spices are boiling, cut your sausage links into 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces.</li>
                                        <li>Cut chicken thighs into smaller, bite-sized pieces (optional, I prefer fuul pieces of chicken).</li>
                                        <li>Add chicken and sausage to the pot.</li>
                                        <li>Boil on medium-high heat for 30 minutes</li>
                                        <li>Reduce heat to low. Allow the gumbo to simmer for 5-24 hours.</li>
                                        <li>Serve on top of cooked white rice.</li>

                                    </ol>
